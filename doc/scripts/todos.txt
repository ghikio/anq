Parse a concrete directory's files for "TODO" commentaries
and print them to STDOUT.

Those TODO must have the next structure in order to be correctly
parsed:

	TODO [NAME PRIORITY] BRIEF SUBJECT

Where NAME is the name of the writer of the comment.
Where PRIORITY is one of the following:
	lp - low priority
	mp - middle priority
	hp - high priority
Where BRIEF SUBJECT is a small introduction to the TODO reason.

NOTE: In this actual version 'todos.pl' only search in *.c / *.h
files. If this is not the future desired behaviour, change it
in the &wanted function.
